# SecondTake
Rewind your personal film and tv series rankings using pairwise comparisons

## Project Vision
Over time, personal film and tv series rankings and ratings tend to lose their meaning.
Titles watched years ago were often rated in a different context, 
with different expectations, taste, and emotional background. 
As a result, many rankings become inconsistent, inflated, or simply outdated.

This project aims to help users re-evaluate and organize previously watched titles by focusing on direct comparison rather than absolute scoring.
Comparing two similar titles at a time allows for more precise judgment and helps naturally rebalance ratings across the entire library.
